Reproducibility Notes
=====================

This file will be overwritten at runtime inside a timestamped experiment directory.

It will explain:
1. Which config snapshot was used.
2. Which seed was used.
3. How to rerun the same experiment with the same data.

You do not need to edit this template manually.
